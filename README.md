# Independant Project - Memory Game

## Project Description 
This project is a simple card flipping memory game. Flip two cards and if they images on the card are identical, they will remain flipped. Continue flipping cards until all of the images are revealed! Once all cards are flipped, they will reveal and shuffle themselves and the game will begin again.
